      <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We do not independently retain any data. In order to render our services, we utilize various Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) which may retain data. Detailed information regarding the storage of data is provided below.
      </p>
      <h3> Joke API </h3>
      <p>
        we are using the joke api provided by <a href="https://sv443.net/">sv443.net</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>This is a list of everything JokeAPI stores temporarily (this data will be deleted after about a month):</b><br>
        <ul>
          <li>A hash of your IP address, your request headers, the request method and the request date and time (this will be kept inside a secure log file so I can debug JokeAPI and help you solve any issues you might have)</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        <b>This is a list of everything JokeAPI stores indefinitely:</b>
        <ul>
          <li>A hash of your IP address <u>if it gets added to the <i>blacklist</i>.</u> This happens if you have shown malicious behavior or have exceeded the rate limiting for too long / often</li>
          <li>A hash of your IP address <u>if it gets added to a <i>whitelist</i>.</u> This only happens if you contacted me to get more requests per minute or are partnered with me and have been informed that this is happening</li>
          <li>A hash of your IP address <u>if it gets added to a <i>console blacklist</i>.</u> This (if at all) also only happens if you are partnered with me</li>
          <li>The requested URL, consisting of the URL path, the URL parameters and the URL anchor</li>
          <li>The payload of joke submissions (using POST requests on the submission endpoint)</li>
      </ul>
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        <b>Terminology:</b><br>
        Hash:
        A hash uses an algorithm to encrypt the input to something that cannot be reconstructed to the initial input again.
        In the case of JokeAPI, your IP address gets hashed and stored to a database.
        In this hashed state, your original IP address can not be reconstructed and you will stay completely anonymous in case any data ever gets leaked, while JokeAPI can still uniquely identify you.

        <br><br>
        Please note that the collection of the above listed data is necessary to provide you this service.
        Without it, rate limiting wouldn't be possible. This would lead to the API and all of my other services being taken down by DoS-attacks.
        This has already happened before and it has impacted all of my services to the point of them being completely unresponsive.
        <br><br>
        You can request to get your collected data deleted or to view the data about you that JokeAPI collected (according to article 12 GDPR) by sending an e-mail: contact@sv443.net

      <p>Web Beacons – A web beacon is a type of picture file used on the Internet. Web beacons are used in combination with cookies to help monitor traffic on the Website and understand the ways in which users interact with content on the Website. Among other uses, we may use web beacons to count visitors to our Website or to monitor how our users navigate our Website. We may include web beacons in email messages to count how many of the messages that we sent were opened, acted upon, and forwarded. We may use web beacons to compile aggregate statistics about our Services and our marketing campaigns.</p>
      
      
      
      <p>Cookies – Cookies help provide a customized user experience. We and our third party service providers may use cookies to, among other things, better serve you with tailored information and facilitate your ongoing access to and use of our Services.

      <p>We use third parties such as network advertisers to serve advertisements on our Website. Network advertisers are third parties that display advertisements based on your visits to our Website and other websites you have visited. This enables us and these third parties to target advertisements to you for products and services in which you might be interested. Third party ad network providers, advertisers, sponsors and/or traffic measurement services may use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (including clear GIFs), Flash LSOs and other technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content to you.

      <p>You may opt-out of many third-party ad networks. The website http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp provides information regarding this practice by Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) members, and your choices regarding having this information used by these companies, including how to “opt-out” of third-party ad networks operated by NAI members.</p>
      
      
      
      <p>You also may contact the Digital Advertising Alliance at http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ for information about opting out of targeted advertising and your choices regarding having information used by About Ads member companies, including how to “opt-out” of third-party ad networks operated by About Ads members. Opting out of one or more NAI members or DAI members (many of which will be the same) only means that those members no longer will deliver targeted content or ads to you, but it does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content or ads on our Website or other websites. You may continue to receive advertisements, for example, based on the particular website that you are viewing. Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit this opt-out page, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different computer or change web browsers, your NAI or DAI opt-out may no longer, be effective. Additional information is available on NAI’s and DAI’s websites accessible by the above links.</p>

      <p>VII. HOW DO WE SECURE YOUR PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION?</p>
      
      
      
      <p>To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of the personally identifiable information we collect, we have implemented physical, electronic, and administrative procedures. These measures are based on commercially reasonable standards that similar companies use.</p>
      
      
      
      <p>NO DATA TRANSMITTED OVER THE INTERNET, HOWEVER, CAN BE GUARANTEED TO BE 100% SECURE AT ALL TIMES. Although we have implemented security measures to protect your personally identifiable information, we cannot and do not guarantee the security of such information.</p>
      
      
      
      <p>VIII. CHILDREN</p>
      
      
      
      <p>This Website is not directed to children. We do not knowingly collect or solicit personally identifiable information from or about children under 13, except as permitted by law.
